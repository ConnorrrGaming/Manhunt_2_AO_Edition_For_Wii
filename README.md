# Manhunt 2 AO Edition For Wii
### The Wii's most violent game is now even more violent!
The aim of this mod is to restore all of the changes Rockstar made, in order to secure an M rating and an 18 rating from the BBFC. 

## What do I need to install this?
You will need to have a retail copy of the game (European is fully tested and working, US version hasn't been extensively tested but should work anyway), a modified Wii/vWii (yes this works on Wii U), Homebrew Channel & Riivolution. 
Simply place the Manhunt2Mod.xml in the Riivolution folder, and the mh2 folder on the root. You should then load the mod from Riivolution, ensuring you have enabled it to work.

By the way, this mod does work on Dolphin, provided you have an extracted backup of your game, so you can change the files in the correct spaces.

## How do I know the mod is working correctly?
The Rockstar Games logo in the beginning will be that of the beta PS2 version, rather than what is present in the retail version. If you don't get this, either the mod isn't installed correctly or you deleted the stinger.bik files.

## What are the changes made?
### -Execution filters have been removed (no red hinting either).
### -Head explosions are possible in executions and melee combat, with all weapons supporting it.
### -Head decaps are possible in executions and melee combat, with all weapons supporting it.

## Can you import stuff from the PC version (ie, uncensored dialog, weapons, etc)?
This is something I am interested in doing, however, after analysing the files of both versions, particularly audio files, they are very different and would take a lot of work to import. For the moment, however, I'm focused on restoring aspects that still remain in the files, and don't require reversing files from different platforms.

## Special thanks to:
### Assembly Community Discord server, for programming support (I am horrible with Assembly code...)
### Ermaccer, for creating the censorship removal patch for PSP, and whose source code helped me understand exactly what needed editing (none of their source code was used).
### My friends (Jodie, Ash & Korrin), who watched me develop this like some mad scientist, and showing their support.
### Rockstar Vienna, for laying the groundwork and developing a decent chunk of Manhunt 2 (Credits for their hard work: https://www.intelligent-artifice.com/2007/11/rockstar-viennas-missing-credits-for-manhunt-2.html)
